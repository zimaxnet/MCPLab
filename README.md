## 2. **Learning Objectives**

Upon completing this guidebook, interns will:

- Understand tokenization and context windows.
- Structure effective prompts for ChatML and OpenAI APIs.
- Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.
- Apply memory management strategies for long conversations.
- Develop multi-turn agents and orchestration chains.
- Implement function calling protocols and tool integrations.
- Design advanced multi-agent and constitutional AI protocols.
