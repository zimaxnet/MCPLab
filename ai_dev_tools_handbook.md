## 1. Claude Code

**Developer:** Anthropic  
**Type:** Command-line agentic coding tool  
**Platform:** macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)

### Overview
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands. By integrating directly with your development environment, Claude Code streamlines your workflow without requiring additional servers or complex setup.

### Key Features
- **Terminal Integration**: Runs in your terminal and works alongside your preferred IDE and development tools without requiring you to change your workflow
- **Codebase Understanding**: Understanding of your codebase and dependencies enables it to make powerful, multi-file edits that actually work
- **MCP Integration**: Functions as both an MCP server and client. As a client, it can connect to any number of MCP servers to access their tools
- **Git Integration**: Built-in capabilities for handling git workflows, merge conflicts, and commit management
- **Context Management**: Use the /clear command frequently between tasks to reset the context window

### Supported Models
Claude Code works with Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Haiku 3.5 models. Enterprise users can run Claude Code using models in existing Amazon Bedrock or Google Cloud Vertex AI instances.

### Best Practices
- **Project Configuration**: For repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the .claude/commands folder
- **Complex Tasks**: For large tasks with multiple steps or requiring exhaustive solutions—like code migrations, fixing numerous lint errors, or running complex build scripts—improve performance by having Claude use a Markdown file (or even a GitHub issue!) as a checklist and working scratchpad
- **Team Collaboration**: You can check these commands into git to make them available for the rest of your team

### Pricing
When used with an Anthropic Console account, Claude Code consumes API tokens at standard API pricing.

## 2. Model Context Protocol (MCPs)

**Developer:** Anthropic  
**Type:** Open standard protocol  
**Status:** Open source

### Overview
The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

### Key Components
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **MCP Clients**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **Protocol Architecture**: At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers

### Core Primitives
The MCP spec defines a set of JSON-RPC messages for communication between Clients and Servers; these messages implement building blocks called primitives. Servers support three primitives: Prompts, Resources, and Tools; Clients support two: Roots and Sampling.

- **Prompts**: Instructions or templates for instructions
- **Resources**: Structured data which can be included in the LLM prompt context  
- **Tools**: Executable functions which LLMs can call to retrieve information or perform actions
- **Roots**: Entry point into a filesystem giving Servers access to files on the Client side
- **Sampling**: Lets Servers request completions or generations from a Client-side LLM

### Industry Adoption
The protocol has become increasingly common in software development tools. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Zed, coding platforms such as Replit, and code intelligence tools like Sourcegraph have all adopted MCP to grant AI coding assistants real-time access to project context.

### Enterprise Support
Microsoft is collaborating with Anthropic to create an official C# SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP has seen rapid adoption in the AI community, and this partnership aims to enhance the integration of AI models into C# applications.
