## 2. Model Context Protocol (MCPs)

**Developer:** Anthropic  
**Type:** Open standard protocol  
**Status:** Open source

### Overview
The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

### Key Components
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **MCP Clients**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **Protocol Architecture**: At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers

### Core Primitives
The MCP spec defines a set of JSON-RPC messages for communication between Clients and Servers; these messages implement building blocks called primitives. Servers support three primitives: Prompts, Resources, and Tools; Clients support two: Roots and Sampling.

- **Prompts**: Instructions or templates for instructions
- **Resources**: Structured data which can be included in the LLM prompt context  
- **Tools**: Executable functions which LLMs can call to retrieve information or perform actions
- **Roots**: Entry point into a filesystem giving Servers access to files on the Client side
- **Sampling**: Lets Servers request completions or generations from a Client-side LLM

### Industry Adoption
The protocol has become increasingly common in software development tools. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Zed, coding platforms such as Replit, and code intelligence tools like Sourcegraph have all adopted MCP to grant AI coding assistants real-time access to project context.

### Enterprise Support
Microsoft is collaborating with Anthropic to create an official C# SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP has seen rapid adoption in the AI community, and this partnership aims to enhance the integration of AI models into C# applications.
